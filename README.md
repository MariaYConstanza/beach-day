# Perfect Beach Day

## Description

This website was created by four aspiring full-stack developers attending the University of Central Florida's coding bootcamp. This assignment required us to pull in at least two server-side APIs in order to fetch data to be displayed to our users. Our application presents surfer-specific weather conditions depending on a location. 

User-desired input is given and a current weather forecast, five-day forecast and geographical location on a map are all presented to the page. Additional links for water levels, reports, tide predictions and benchmarks are also included. 

We learned a lot while developing this website. We learned how to use a different CSS framework besides Bootstrap called Tailwind. We also learned how to fetch data from multiple APIs and adapting to multiple roadblocks along the way to developing a professional and functional web applilcation. 

Most importantly, we learned how to collaborate with other developers to take what started out as just an idea for a website from our head and work together to deploy a web application made from scratch. We learned how to navigate effectively to make changes on our project via GitHub and were re-humbled about the crucial importance of communication and teamwork. In conclusion, we incorporated a fun, Owen Wilson theme to our website to keep us laughing and engaged while increasing user-satisfaction. 

## User Story

AS A surfer
I WANT to be able to view the weather conditions based on different locations
SO THAT I can figure out where and when the optimal surfing conditions are going to occur

## Usage

Once deployed, the application can be viewed in a traditional desktop web browser. It is also optimized for laptop, tablet, and smartphone.

## Credits

Collaborators on this project included instructional staff, TAs, and students from University of Central Florida.

Jessica Almand, Maria Constanza, Mary Elenus, and Taber Youmans

A special thanks to my daughter, Yennefer. Every day she proves she is small but mighty!
